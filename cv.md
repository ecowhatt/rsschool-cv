### About me:
At the moment I am in the process of moving to Portugal due to the situation in the world. I have been working as a project manager for almost a year, but at the same time, I am more passionate about programming. Previously, I took a short course in python, but, unfortunately, I did not continue further training. After a while, I realized that programming is what I would like to do.
